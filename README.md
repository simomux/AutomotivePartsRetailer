# Project for my Web Technologies exam A.Y. 2023/2024
## Summary
This web app is designed to help local car parts retailers reach more clients via e-commerce.

An unregistered user can visit the e-commerce site but cannot order anything unless they register first.

A registered user can add items to their shopping cart and make an order after choosing a method of payment and specifying shipping details.

The owner of the shop manages orders and prepares them for shipping.

Once an order is shipped, a notification is sent to the user, informing them of the shipment and specifying the expected delivery date.
